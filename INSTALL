Before You Begin
================
 GluCat uses the C++ Standard Library and the Boost Library. Make sure
 you have these installed and working before attempting to use GluCat.
 Use the instructions at http://www.boost.org/more/download.html
 to obtain the Boost Library.

 Make sure that you have installed Boost with the same version of g++ as you
 will be using with GluCat.

 The headers need a compiler which correctly handles template template classes,
 such as g++ 4.X.

 The headers also need an include library which either defines the macro isnan
 or defines std::isnan.

 GluCat 0.5.0 has so far been tested using:

1) Dual Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 with
o Kubuntu 9.10 (Karmic), with
  * gcc version 4.4.1, Boost 1.38.0, QD 2.3.10.

2) AMD Athlon(tm) 64 with
o openSUSE Linux 11.2, with
  * gcc version 4.4.1, Boost 1.37.0, 1.39.0, 1.40.0, 1.41.0, QD 2.3.10.
  * Intel C++ version 11.1, Boost 1.39.0, no QD.

3) Quad-Core AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 8360 SE with
o Debian Linux 5.0.4 (Lenny), with
  * gcc version 4.3.4, Boost 1.34.1, no QD.

 PyCliCal for GluCat 0.5.0 has so far been tested using:

1) Dual Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 with
o Kubuntu 9.10 (Karmic), with
  * gcc version 4.4.1, Boost 1.38.0, Python 2.6.4, Cython 0.11.2.

2) AMD Athlon(tm) 64 with
o openSUSE Linux 11.2, with
  * gcc version 4.4.1, Boost 1.39.0, Python 2.6.2, Cython 0.10.3.

   Notes:
1. GluCat 0.5.0 will not work with QD versions earlier than 2.3.10,
   because older versions do not zero-initialize dd_real and qd_real
   as required by ublas::clear().
2. GluCat 0.5.0 has not been tested with gcc versions earlier than 4.4.1.
3. With gcc version 4.4.1 and Boost versions earlier than 1.37.0, compilation
   may result in error messages like: 
boost/mpl/apply_wrap.hpp:81:31: error: missing binary operator before token "("
   See https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2069 (fixed in Boost 1.37.0).
4. GluCat 0.5.0 with QD 2.3.10 cannot be built with the Intel C++ compiler
   (tested with icpc version 11.1) The problem is with isnan() and isinf(),
   which are std:: functions with g++ but macros with icpc.

To Test
=======
 Once you have downloaded, unzipped and untarred the source code,
 you should have a directory, glucat-xxx, where xxx is the version number.
 Under glucat-xxx you should see a number of directories, including ./admin,
 ./glucat, ./glucat_gfft, ./glucat-api, ./squaring ./test and ./transforms
 The following instructions are meant to be used with glucat-xxx as the current
 directory.

The Test Programs
-----------------
 The test script ./test/test.sh takes any number (including zero) of numeric 
 parameters. Parameters in the range "00" to "16" correspond to coding examples
 ./test00/peg00.h to ./test16/peg16.h. These examples are run in numerical
 order. With zero parameters, all examples from 00 to 16 are run in order. Many
 of the examples are run twice - once with framed_multi<Scalar_T> and once with 
 matrix_multi<Scalar_T>. 

 The test program ./gfft_test/gfft_test takes a parameter n, and transforms
 larger and larger multivectors within the subalgebra defined by the frame of
 the index set {-n, ..., -1, 1, ..., n}
 
 The test program ./products/products takes a parameter n, and runs a timing
 test which uses the products *, ^, % and & to multply larger and larger 
 multivectors within subalgebras defined by frames limited by the value of n.

 The test program ./squaring/squaring takes a parameter n, and runs a timing
 test which squares larger and larger multivectors within subalgebras defined
 by frames limited by the value of n.

 The test program ./transforms/transforms takes a parameter n, and transforms
 larger and larger multivectors within the subalgebras defined by  frames
 limited by the value of n.
 
 The test script ./test/timing_tests.sh takes up to 4 numeric parameters.
 The command "./test/timing_tests.sh $a $b $c $d" runs
  ./products/products $a
  ./squaring/squaring $b
  ./gfft_test/gfft_test $c
  ./transforms/transforms $d
 The default is:
  ./products/products 8
  ./squaring/squaring 11
  ./gfft_test/gfft_test 11
  ./transforms/transforms 8

Both ./test00 and ./test11 allow the program arguments --help and --verbose.
The argument --verbose produces verbose output essentially by setting the error
tolerance to zero. Verbose output can become quite large.

The test script ./test/test_optional.sh takes one parameter, and runs all
examples 00 to 16 in order, with the given parameter as a program argument.
Right now this is not very useful, because only ./test00 and ./test11 recognize
program arguments.

The directory ./pyclical contains the PyCliCal prototype interface to Python,
the example Python file pyclical_demo.py, and the example output file
pyclical_demo.out.

To Make the Test Programs
-------------------------
 To create the GluCat test programs, set the environment variable CXX to 
 indicate your C++ compiler, eg. "g++" for GNU C++, "icc" for Intel C++, then
 run ./configure, then make. Some options to ./configure are described below.
 See "Usage" in README for more details.

 Make uses the headers in ./glucat and ./test and the source in ./test??,
 ./gfft_test, ./products, ./squaring and ./transforms to make the test programs
 ./test??/test??, ./gfft_test/gfft_test, ./products/products, ./squaring/squaring 
 and  ./transforms/transforms
 
 Once you have created the test programs, copy the runtime directory
 ./test_runtime to a convenient place. ./test_runtime contains the test input
 file eg8.txt. This file is needed by programming example 8 (reading
 multivectors from input).

 The sample test output files are eg3.res, test.out, gfft_test-11.out,
 products-8.out, squaring-11.out and transforms-8.out

 The main test script is ./test/test.sh. This runs tests ./test00/test00 to
 ./test16/test16, using relative pathnames, so it is best to leave test.sh
 where it is and invoke it using the full path name. This allows it to find
 test00 to test16.

 To create meaningful timing tests, run ./configure --enable-debug=no, then 
 make.  Setting --enable-debug=no will invoke the highest optimization level of 
 the relevant compiler. 

 To compile the tests using std::map for glucat::framed_multi<>,
 run ./configure --with-map=map, then make.

 To compile the tests using __gnu_cxx::hash_map for glucat::framed_multi<>,
 run ./configure --with-map=hash, then make. This adds
 -D_GLUCAT_USE_GNU_CXX_HASH_MAP to CXXFLAGS in the test Makefiles, depending
 on whether you are using the g++ compiler.

 To compile the tests using std::tr1::unordered_map for glucat::framed_multi<>,
 run ./configure --with-map=unordered, or just run ./configure, then make.
 The default argument to --with-map is unordered, so ./configure with no options
 has the same effect as ./configure --with-map=unordered. This adds
 -D_GLUCAT_USE_TR1_UNORDERED_MAP to CXXFLAGS in the test Makefiles. 

 To compile the tests using compressed matrices, run ./configure --without-dense-mat,
 then make. This prevents -D_GLUCAT_USE_DENSE_MATRIX_MATRICES from being added to
 CXXFLAGS in the test Makefiles.

 To compile the tests using dd_real and qd_real, run ./configure --with-qd,
 then make. This adds -D_GLUCAT_USE_QD to CXXFLAGS in the test Makefiles, and
 adds -lqd to all_libraries.

 To compile the tests using GSL random numbers, run ./configure --with-random=gsl,
 then make. This adds -D_GLUCAT_USE_GSL_RANDOM to CXXFLAGS in the test Makefiles.

 To compile the tests using TR1 random numbers, run ./configure --with-random=tr1,
 or just run ./configure, then make. The default argument to --with-random is tr1,
 so ./configure with no options has the same effect as ./configure --with-random=tr1.

 The sample timing test results in ./test_runtime were built and run using
 ./configure --with-unordered-map --with-dense-mat --enable-debug=no
 on AMD Athlon(tm) 64 3200+, openSUSE Linux 11.2, g++ 4.4.1, Boost 1.39.0.
 
 If you are using Linux on Intel, you can also:
 o create a full debug version of the tests: 
   run ./configure --enable-debug=full, then make.
 o create a version for profiling:
   run ./configure --enable-profile, then make. 

 Further warnings:
 1) The optimized compilation may take a long time to complete.

 2) Many Clifford algebra algorithms are exponential in both time and
 space complexity.

 3) Detailed generic instructions for ./configure are given in "Basic
 Installation" below. See also ./configure --help

The PyCliCal Python extension
-----------------------------
 Glucat includes a proptotype Python extension called PyCliCal. PyCliCal is written in
 C++ and Cython, and is defined in the files pyclical/PyCliCal.h and pyclical/PyClical.pyx.
 PyCliCal is designed to be installed using make.

 To build the PyCliCal prototype Python interface, run ./configure --enable-pyclical,
 then make. This sets the conditional flag make_pyclical in the Makefile for GluCat,
 and adds the directory ./pyclical to the SUBDIRS list, which is the list of
 subdirectories to be built. For PyCliCal to build successfully, you will need recent
 versions of both Python and Cython. You will need to ensure that the compiler can find
 the header file Python.h, by using the --with-extra-includes option to ./configure,
 if necessary.

 If you have run ./configure --enable-pyclical, then when you run make in the top level
 directory, make will build all of the tests, and then build pyclical. Make builds
 pyclical by running the command

   CXXFLAGS="$(CXXFLAGS)" INCLUDES="$(INCLUDES)" LDFLAGS="$(LDFLAGS)" \
   python setup.py build_ext --inplace

 with INCLUDES=$(all_includes), LDFLAGS=$(all_libraries) and the values of CXXFLAGS,
 all_includes and all_libraries set by ./configure. You can run pyclical/setup.py
 yourself, but you must set the environment variables CXXFLAGS, INCLUDES and LDFLAGS to
 apppropriate values.

To Install
==========
 Once you are satisfied that GluCat works, you can run make install.
 What make install does is to install the headers from ./glucat into the
 installation directory, which defaults to /usr/local/include
 You will need permission to update this directory, so you may need to
 su to root before you run make install.

Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes a while.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
