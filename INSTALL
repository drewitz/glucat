INSTALL for GluCat 0.7.5 with PyClical
======================================

Prerequisites: Before You Begin
===============================

GluCat uses the C++ Standard Library and the Boost Library. The PyClical Python
extension module is built using Cython and Python. Make sure that you have all
of these installed and working before attempting to use GluCat with PyClical.
Use the instructions at http://www.boost.org/more/download.html to obtain
the Boost Library. Make sure that you are able to build the Boost library with
the same C++ compiler version as you will be using to build programs that will
use the GluCat library.

Scroll to the end of these instructions to see a list of successful builds,
including version numbers of various software components, and notes on software
versions.


Directory Structure
===================

Once you have downloaded, unzipped and untarred the source code, you should
have a directory, glucat-0.7.5. Under this directory you should see a number
of subdirectories, including ./admin, ./doc, ./glucat, ./gfft_test, ./products,
./pyclical, ./squaring, ./test, ./test_runtime, ./testxx, and ./transforms.

The following instructions are meant to be used with glucat-0.7.5 as the
current directory.


Installation Summary
====================

There are three different types of program that you can make using the GluCat
library with PyClical. These are:

 1. The test programs.
 2. The PyClical Python extension module.
 3. Your own programs, written in C++.

There are two different things to install. These are:

 1. The GluCat C++ header files.
 2. The PyClical Python extension module.

The simplest way to install GluCat with PyClical is to run the following
commands, in order:

 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install
 make clean

More details of the installation process are given below.


The Three Different Types of Programs
=====================================

The test programs
-----------------

GluCat includes two types test programs, functionality (regression) tests and
speed (timing) tests. The regression tests are also used as programming
examples. The source code for the regression tests is in the subdirectories
./test00 to ./test16. The source code for the timing tests is in ./gfft_test,
./products, ./squaring and ./transforms. Compilation of these test programs
uses C++ headers defined in ./test as well as ./glucat.

The PyClical Python extension module
------------------------------------

GluCat includes a Python extension module called PyClical.

The subdirectory ./pyclical contains source code for the PyClical extension
module, and the subdirectory ./pyclical/demos, contains demo and tutorial files
written in Python.

PyClical is written in C++ and Cython, and is defined in the files
pyclical/glucat.pxd, pyclical/PyClical.h, pyclical/PyClical.pdx, and
pyclical/PyClical.pyx.

Your own programs, written in C++
---------------------------------

Once you have installed  the GluCat C++ library, you can build your own C++
programs using this library. To do this, you will need to follow some or all of
the same steps you took to build the test programs and the PyClical. This
includes setting compiler flags, and including relevant headers and libraries.
Pay special attention to the -D flags described in the configuration section
below, as these control optional parts of the compilation of the GluCat library.
To automate the build process, you should use GNU make with your own Makefile.
For very elaborate software, you may also want to consider using Autotools.


To Configure
============

The build process for both the test programs and PyClical uses a single
./configure shell script and a single overall Makefile, plus Makefiles in the
relevant subdirectories.

As briefly described above, the simplest way to install this package is:

 1. "cd" to the glucat-0.7.5 directory containing the source code and type
    "./configure" to configure GluCat with PyClical for your system.
    If you are using "csh" on an old version of System V, you might need to type
    "sh ./configure" instead to prevent "csh" from trying to execute
    ./configure itself.

    Running ./configure takes a while.  While running, it prints some messages
    telling which features it is checking for.

 2. Type "make" to compile GluCat with PyClical.

 3. Type "make install" to install the programs and any data files and
    documentation.  Depending on where you have chosen to install GluCat with
    PyClical, you make need to use "sudo" or you may need to log in as "root"
    to perform this operation.

 4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source code
    directory by typing "make clean".

This section describes the first step in detail.

The ./configure shell script attempts to guess correct values for various
system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses those values to
create a Makefile in each relevant subdirectory.  It may also create one or
more ".h" files containing system-dependent definitions.  Finally, it creates a
shell script ./config.status that you can run in the future to recreate the
current configuration, a file  ./config.cache that saves the results of its
tests to speed up reconfiguring, and a file ./config.log containing compiler
output (useful mainly for debugging ./configure).

If you need to do unusual things to compile GluCat with PyClical, please try to
figure out how ./configure could check whether to do them, and email diffs or
instructions to the address given in the ./README file so they can be considered
for the next release.  If at some point ./config.cache contains results you don't
want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

The file ./configure.in is used to create ./configure by a program called
"autoconf".  You only need ./configure.in if you want to change or regenerate
 ./configure using a newer version of "autoconf".


Compilers and Options
---------------------

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
./configure script does not know about.  You can give ./configure initial values
for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using a Bourne-compatible
shell, you can do that on the command line like this:
    CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the "env" program, you can do it like this:
    env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure


Optional Features
-----------------

Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.

Installation directories:
  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                          [/usr/local]

By default, "make install" will install the GluCat C++ headers in
/usr/local/include/glucat, and will install the PyClical.so shared object file
in a directory under /usr/local whose full pathname is determined by Python, for
example /usr/local/lib64/python2.7/site-packages. You can specify an installation
prefix other than /usr/local by using the option "--prefix=PREFIX", for example
"--prefix=$HOME".


  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
                          [PREFIX]

The option "--exec-prefix=EPREFIX" changes the installation prefix for PyClical,
without affecting the installation prefix for the GluCat C++ headers.


  --enable-debug[=ARG]    enables debug symbols (yes|no|full) [default=no]

This option controls debugging and optimization options. ARG can be "yes", "no"
or "full". The default is "no".

The option "--enable-debug=no" adds the compiler flag "-DNDEBUG" to CXXFLAGS in
the Makefiles, and turns on optimizations, such as adding the compiler flag
"-O3" to CXXFLAGS in the Makefiles, as well as a number of compiler and version
dependent optimization flags. The optimized compilation may take a long time to
complete.

The option "--enable-debug=yes" adds the compiler flag "-DNDEBUG" to CXXFLAGS in
the Makefiles, and turns on debugging, by adding the compiler flags "-O1 -g" to
CXXFLAGS in the Makefiles.

The option "--enable-debug=yes" turns on full debugging, by adding the compiler
flags "-O0 -g3" to CXXFLAGS in the Makefiles, and does not add the compiler flag
"-DNDEBUG" to CXXFLAGS in the Makefiles.

The preprocessor symbol NDEBUG is used by Boost uBLAS to control debugging.
If NDEBUG is defined, then uBLAS compiles in release mode, including the use of
expression templates. If NDEBUG is not defined, then uBLAS compiles in debug
mode.


If you are compiling your own programs using the GluCat library, to control
debugging and performance, your Makefile needs to pass the following flags to
the C++ compiler.

 For full production and timing tests:
  "-DNDEBUG -O3"

 For testing with some debugging capability:
  "-DNDEBUG -O1 -g"

 For full debugging capability, including the use of debug code in uBLAS:
  "-O0 -g3"


  --disable-debug         disables debug output and debug symbols [default=yes]

Since the default for "--enable-debug" is "no", the option "--disable-debug"
does nothing.


  --enable-pyclical       uses Cython to build PyClical Python extension module
                          [default=yes]

This option determines whether the PyClical Python extension module is built.
The option "--enable-pyclical" sets the conditional flag make_pyclical in the
Makefile for GluCat, and adds the directory ./pyclical to the SUBDIRS list,
which is the list of subdirectories to be built. This is the default behaviour.
If you do not want to build PyClical, use the option "--disable-pyclical".

For PyClical to build successfully using pyclical/Makefile, you will need a
recent version of Python and (optionally) a recent version of Cython. You will
also need to ensure that the compiler can find the header file <Python.h>, by
using the "--with-extra-includes" option, if necessary. If your computer has
Python installed, but not Cython, you can build PyClical from the provided
PyClical.cpp file. See details in "To Build" below.


Optional Packages
-----------------

  --with-extra-includes=DIR

This option adds non standard include paths.


  --with-extra-libs=DIR

This option adds non standard library paths


  --with-map[=ARG]        type of map to use
                          (map|stdunordered)
                          [default=stdunordered]

This option controls preprocessor symbols of the form _GLUCAT_USE_*_MAP that
determine the type of map used by glucat::framed_multi<>. ARG can be "map"
or "stdunordered". The default is "stdunordered".

The option "--with-map=map" adds nothing to CXXFLAGS in the Makefile, so that
glucat::framed_multi<> uses std::map<>.

The option "--with-map=stdunordered" adds "-D_GLUCAT_USE_STD_UNORDERED_MAP" to
CXXFLAGS in the Makefiles, if the header file <unordered_map> is usable.
If the g++ compiler is being used, the compiler flag "-std=c++11" rather than
"-ansi" is added to CXXFLAGS, to tell g++ to use the C++ 2011 standard.


By default glucat/framed_multi.h defines glucat::framed_multi<> using
std::map<>, which is a sorted map.

If _GLUCAT_USE_GNU_CXX_HASH_MAP is defined, then if _GLUCAT_USE_BACKWARD_HASH_MAP
is also defined, glucat/framed_multi.h includes the header file
<backward/hash_map>, otherwise glucat/framed_multi.h includes the header file
<ext/hash_map>. In either case, glucat/framed_multi.h defines
glucat::framed_multi<> using __gnu_cxx::hash_map<>.
*This option is deprecated and will be removed in a later version of GluCat.*

If _GLUCAT_USE_TR1_UNORDERED_MAP is defined, glucat/framed_multi.h includes
the header file <tr1/unordered_map> and defines glucat::framed_multi<>
using std::tr1::unordered_map<>.
*This option is deprecated and will be removed in a later version of GluCat.*

If _GLUCAT_USE_STD_UNORDERED_MAP is defined, glucat/framed_multi.h includes
the header file <unordered_map> and defines glucat::framed_multi<> using
std::unordered_map<>.


If you are compiling your own programs using the GluCat library, to choose the
type of map used by glucat::framed_multi<>, your Makefile needs to pass the
following flags to the C++ compiler, and the corresponding header files must
exist.

 For std::map<>: no flags.

 For __gnu_cxx::hash_map<> from <ext/hash_map> with the g++ compiler:
  "-D_GLUCAT_USE_GNU_CXX_HASH_MAP"
*This option is deprecated and will be removed in a later version of GluCat.*

 For __gnu_cxx::hash_map<> from <backward/hash_map> with the g++ compiler:
  "-D_GLUCAT_USE_GNU_CXX_HASH_MAP -D_GLUCAT_USE_BACKWARD_HASH_MAP"
*This option is deprecated and will be removed in a later version of GluCat.*

 For std::tr1::unordered_map<>:
  "-D_GLUCAT_USE_TR1_UNORDERED_MAP"
*This option is deprecated and will be removed in a later version of GluCat.*

 For std::unordered_map<>:
  "-D_GLUCAT_USE_STD_UNORDERED_MAP"
  If you are using g++, pass the compiler flag "-std=c++11" rather than "-ansi".
  This tells g++ to use the 2011 C++ standard.


If _GLUCAT_USE_BOOST_POOL_ALLOC is defined, glucat/framed_multi.h includes
the header file <boost/pool/poolfwd.hpp> and defines glucat::framed_multi<>
using boost::fast_pool_allocator<>; and glucat/framed_multi.h includes
the header file <boost/pool/pool_alloc.hpp>.

If you are compiling your own programs using the GluCat library, to use the
Boost pool allocator, your Makefile needs to pass the following flag to the
C++ compiler:  "-D_GLUCAT_USE_BOOST_POOL_ALLOC"

You will also need to ensure that the include path used by the compiler sees
<boost/pool/poolfwd.hpp> and <boost/pool/pool_alloc.hpp>. In addition, if you
are using Boost 1.50.0 or later, your Makefile needs to pass the following flag
to the C++ compiler, after all the linker-related flags: "-lboost_system"

You will also need to ensure that the library path sees libboost_system.*.
This requires that you have the Boost libraries built and installed.
See http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/more/getting_started/index.html
and Boost tickets
https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7085
https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7335


  --with-dense-mat        uses dense matrices [default=yes]

This option controls the preprocessor symbol _GLUCAT_USE_DENSE_MATRICES that
determines the type of matrix used by glucat::matrix_multi<>.

The option "--with-dense-mat" adds "-D_GLUCAT_USE_DENSE_MATRICES" to CXXFLAGS in
the Makefiles. This is the default. If you do not want dense matrices, you can
use the option "--without-dense-mat".


If _GLUCAT_USE_DENSE_MATRICES is defined, glucat/matrix_multi.h defines
glucat::matrix_multi<> using ublas::matrix<>, which is a dense matrix.
Otherwise matrix_multi.h defines glucat::matrix_multi<> using
ublas::compressed_matrix<>, which a compressed matrix type. In either case,
basis matrices always use ublas::compressed_matrix<>.


To compile your own programs using the GluCat library with dense matrices,
your Makefile needs to pass the flag "-D_GLUCAT_USE_DENSE_MATRICES" to the C++
compiler.


  --with-qd               uses dd_real and qd_real [default=no]

This option controls the use of the QD high precision floating point library.

The option "--with-qd" adds "-D_GLUCAT_USE_QD" to CXXFLAGS and adds the flag
"-lqd" to the list of libraries, "all_libraries" in the Makefiles, if the header
file <qd/qd_real.h> and the library libqd are usable.


If _GLUCAT_USE_QD is defined, glucat/qd.h includes <qd/qd_real.h> and supports
the use of QD in GluCat by defining specializations for numeric_traits<dd_real>
and numeric_traits<qd_real>.


To compile your own programs using the GluCat library with QD, your Makefile
needs to pass the flags "-D_GLUCAT_USE_QD" and "-lqd" to the C++ compiler.
You will also need to ensure that the include path used by the compiler sees
<qd/qd_real.h> and the library path sees libqd.*.


  --with-random[=ARG]     type of random number generator to use
                          (std|gsl) [default=std]

This option controls preprocessor symbols of the form _GLUCAT_USE_*_MAP that
determine which random number generators are used by glucat::random_generator<>
defined in glucat/random.h. ARG can be "std" or "gsl". The default is
"std".

The option "--with-random=std" adds "D_GLUCAT_USE_STD_RANDOM" to CXXFLAGS in the
Makefiles, if the header file <random> is usable. If the g++ compiler is being
used, the compiler flag "-std=c++11" rather than "-ansi" is added to CXXFLAGS,
to tell g++ to use the C++ 2011 standard.

The option "--with-random=gsl" adds "-D_GLUCAT_USE_GSL_RANDOM" to CXXFLAGS and
adds the flags "-lgsl" and "-lgslcblas" to the list of libraries, "all_libraries"
in the Makefiles, if the header file <gsl/gsl_rng.h> and the libraries libgsl
and libgslcblas are usable.


By default the TR1 random number generators are used: glucat/random.h includes
<tr1/random>.
*This default is deprecated and will be changed in a later version of GluCat.*

If _GLUCAT_USE_GSL_RANDOM is defined, the GSL random number generators are used:
glucat/random.h includes <gsl/gsl_rng.h> and <gsl/gsl_randist.h>.

Otherwise, if _GLUCAT_USE_STD_RANDOM is defined, the C++ 2011 STD random number
generators are used: glucat/random.h includes <random>.


If you are compiling your own programs using the GluCat library, to choose the
type of random number generators used by glucat::random_generator<>, your
Makefile needs to pass the following flags to the C++ compiler, and the
corresponding header files and libraries must be usable.

 For C++ 2011 STD random number generators:
  "-D_GLUCAT_USE_STD_RANDOM"
  If you are using g++, pass the compiler flag "-std=c++11" rather than "-ansi".
  This tells g++ to use the 2011 C++ standard.

 For TR1 random number generators: no flags.
 *This default is deprecated and will be changed in a later version of GluCat.*

 For GSL random number generators:
  "-D_GLUCAT_USE_GSL_RANDOM -lgsl -lgslcblas"
  You will also need to ensure that the include path used by the compiler sees
  <gsl/gsl_rng.h> and the library path sees libgsl.* and libgslcblas.*.


  --with-eig[=ARG]        library to use for eigenvalues
                          (no|bindings) [default=no]

This option is used to control _GLUCAT_USE_EIGENVALUES and determine which
libraries to use. ARG can be "no" or "bindings". The default is "no".

The option "--with-eig=bindings" adds
"-D_GLUCAT_USE_EIGENVALUES -D_GLUCAT_USE_BINDINGS" to  CXXFLAGS and adds the
flags "-llapack -lblas" to the list of libraries, "all_libraries" in the
Makefiles, if the header file <boost/numeric/bindings/driver/lapack/gees.hpp>
and the libraries liblapack and libblas are usable.


The preprocessor symbol _GLUCAT_USE_EIGENVALUES controls whether the sqrt() and
log() functions in glucat/matrix_multi_imp.h  detect and handle negative real
eigenvalues and imaginary eigenvalues correctly. If _GLUCAT_USE_EIGENVALUES is
defined, then sqrt() and log() call the function classify_eigenvalues(), defined
in glucat/matrix_imp.h, to detect negative real eigenvalues and imaginary
eigenvalues, and handle negative real eigenvalues by expanding the algebra.
Otherwise, sqrt() and log() operate as per GluCat 0.5.0 and earlier, which gives
incorrect results in the case of negative real eigenvalues.

The function eigenvalues() in glucat/matrix_imp.h calls an external function
to obtain the eigenvalues of a matrix. Which function is used depends on one of
a number of preprocessor symbols:

If _GLUCAT_USE_ALGLIB is defined, glucat/matrix_imp.h includes <alglib/evd.h>
and uses the Alglib library of Bochkanov and Bystritsky: http://www.alglib.net/.
*This option is deprecated and will be removed in a later version of GluCat.*

If _GLUCAT_USE_BINDINGS_V1 is defined, glucat/matrix_imp.h includes
<boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/gees.hpp> and uses version 1 of the Boost Numeric
Bindings library, as packaged by Klöckner:
http://mathema.tician.de/software/boost-numeric-bindings/.
*This option is deprecated and will be removed in a later version of GluCat.*

If _GLUCAT_USE_BINDINGS is defined, glucat/matrix_imp.h includes
<boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/driver/gees.hpp> and uses the SVN sandbox version
of the Boost Numeric Bindings library, as per
http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/numeric_bindings/.


To compile your own programs using the GluCat library, to detect and correctly
handle negative real eigenvalues in the sqrt() and log() functions, your
Makefile needs to pass the flag "-D_GLUCAT_USE_EIGENVALUES" to the C++ compiler,
as well as one of the following choices of flags, and the corresponding header
files and libraries must be usable.

 For Alglib:
  "-D_GLUCAT_USE_ALGLIB -lalglib"
  You will also need to ensure that the include path used by the compiler sees
  <alglib/evd.h> and the library path sees libalglib.*.
*This option is deprecated and will be removed in a later version of GluCat.*

 For Boost Numeric Bindings version 1:
  "-D_GLUCAT_USE_BINDINGS_V1 -llapack -lblas"
  You will also need to ensure that the include path used by the compiler sees
  <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/gees.hpp> and the library path sees liblapack.*
  and libblas.*.
*This option is deprecated and will be removed in a later version of GluCat.*

 For Boost Numeric Bindings sandbox:
  "-D_GLUCAT_USE_BINDINGS -llapack -lblas"
  You will also need to ensure that the include path used by the compiler sees
  <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/driver/gees.hpp> and the library path sees
 liblapack.* and libblas.*.


Operation Controls
------------------

 ./configure recognizes the following options to control how it operates.

 --cache-file=FILE
      Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
      ./config.cache.  Set FILE to "/dev/null" to disable caching, to debug the
      ./configure script.

 --help
      Print a summary of the options to ./configure, and exit.

 --quiet
 --silent
 -q
      Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.

 --srcdir=DIR
      Look for source code in directory DIR.  Usually ./configure can determine
      that directory automatically.

 --version
      Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the ./configure script,
      and exit.

 ./configure also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.


To Build
========

Building the test programs
---------------------------

To create the GluCat test programs, set the environment variable CXX to
indicate your C++ compiler, eg. "g++" for GNU C++, "icc" for Intel C++, then
run "make".

Make uses the headers in ./glucat and ./test and the source in ./test??,
./gfft_test, ./products, ./squaring and ./transforms to make the test programs
./test??/test??, ./gfft_test/gfft_test, ./products/products,
./squaring/squaring and  ./transforms/transforms, and (by default) ./pyclical.


Building PyClical
-----------------

If you have run "./configure", then when you run "make" in the top level
directory, make will build all of the tests, and then build PyClical.
If Cython is installed then make builds PyClical by running the command

 ext_name="$(ext_name)" source_pyx="$(ext_name).pyx" \
 CXXFLAGS="$(EXTCXXFLAGS)" INCLUDES="$(INCLUDES)" LDFLAGS="$(LDFLAGS)" \
 python setup.py build_ext --inplace

with INCLUDES=$(all_includes), LDFLAGS=$(all_libraries) and the values of
CXXFLAGS,  all_includes, all_libraries and ext_name set by ./configure.
In particular, ext_name is set to "PyClical". You can run pyclical/setup.py
yourself, but you must set the environment variables ext_name, source_pyx,
CXXFLAGS, INCLUDES and LDFLAGS to appropriate values. See "To Configure" above
to determine these values.

Alternatively, if you have Python installed but do not have Cython, then
./configure will recognize this, and make will build PyClical via the command

 ext_name="$(ext_name)" source_cpp="$(ext_name).cpp" \
 CXXFLAGS="$(EXTCXXFLAGS)" INCLUDES="$(INCLUDES)" LDFLAGS="$(LDFLAGS)" \
 python setup_nocython.py build_ext --inplace

with INCLUDES=$(all_includes), LDFLAGS=$(all_libraries) and the values of
CXXFLAGS,  all_includes, all_libraries and ext_name set by ./configure.
Again, you can run pyclical/setup_nocython.py yourself, but you must set all
of the relevant environment variables to appropriate values.


Building Pyclical notebooks
---------------------------

In the pyclical/demos directory, there is a Python script
build_pyclical_notebooks.py. This script builds a set of IPython notebooks
that correspond to the Pyclical tutorials. The notebooks reproduce the
contents of the tutorials, but do not have the capability to check the
exercises. To build the notebooks, change directory to pyclical/demos and run

 python build_pyclical_notebooks.py

The script is written to run standalone: if you are running Linux or a Unix
equivalent, the command

 ./build_pyclical_notebooks.py

should also work.


To Test
=======

Running the test programs
-------------------------

Once you have built the test programs, copy the runtime directory
./test_runtime to a convenient place. ./test_runtime contains the test input
file eg8.txt. This file is needed by programming example 8 (reading
multivectors from input).

The sample test output files include eg3.res, gfft_test-11.out, products-8.out,
squaring-11.out and transforms-8.out. There are also eight versions of the
output of the main test script. These are described below.

The main test script is ./test/test.sh. This runs tests ./test00/test00 to
./test16/test16, using relative pathnames, so it is best to leave test.sh
where it is and invoke it using the full path name. This allows it to find
test00 to test16.

The test script ./test/test.sh takes any number (including zero) of numeric
parameters. Parameters in the range "00" to "16" correspond to coding examples
./test00/test00 to ./test16/test16. These examples are run in numerical
order. With zero parameters, all examples from 00 to 16 are run in order. Many
of the examples are run twice - once with framed_multi<Scalar_T> and once with
matrix_multi<Scalar_T>.

The ./test_runtime directory contains eight versions of the sample test results,
corresponding to eight different combinations of configuration parameters. The
tests were all run on Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU 870  @ 2.93GHz+ with
    Linux 3.19.0-26-generic #28-Ubuntu SMP x86_64
    gcc version 5.1.1 20150504 (Ubuntu 5.1.1-4ubuntu12)
    Boost 1.55.0
    Boost Numeric Bindings
    QD 2.3.13

The test output file names and corresponding configuration commands are:

1) test.configure.out
./configure

2) test.configure.qd.out
./configure --with-qd

3) test.configure.qd-map-map.out
./configure --with-qd --with-map=map

4) test.configure.qd-map-map-gsl.out
./configure --with-qd --with-map=map --with-random=gsl

5) test.configure.eig-bindings.out

7) test.configure.qd-eig-bindings-map-map.out
./configure --with-qd \
            --with-eig=bindings --with-extra-includes=$PATHTO/numeric_bindings \
            --with-map=map

8) test.configure.qd-eig-bindings-map-map-gsl.out
./configure --with-qd \
            --with-eig=bindings --with-extra-includes=$PATHTO/numeric_bindings \
            --with-map=map --with-random=gsl

When you run your own test using ./test/test.sh, you should compare its output to
the output file corresponding to the closest match to the configuration options
you used to build your copy of the GluCat library.

The reason why sample test results corresponding to eight different combinations
of configuration parameters are included in test_runtime is that the test output
strongly depends on the configuration options chosen. In particular:

o If --with-qd is chosen, extra tests in ./test00/test00 and ./test11/test11 are
  done using the dd_real and qd_real scalar types.

o If --with-eig=X is chosen, with X set to bindings, the algorithms used for the
  square root, logarithm and inverse trig functions will become much more 
  accurate, and more tests in ./test11/test11 will succeed.
  Even if one of these options are chosen, some tests in ./test11/test11 fail
  due to insufficient accuracy. This is most likely caused by a combination of
  excessive round off and truncation error with respect to the condition numbers
  of the matrices used in calculating these functions.

The tests typically use floating point arithmetic, and ./test00/test00 and
./test11/test11 in particular also use random number generators. Therefore if
you run the tests using different architecture, compilers or random number
generators, you should expect to have different floating point arithmetic
results, but generally, still within acceptable error tolerances, except as
notes for ./test11/test11 above.

Both ./test00/test00 and ./test11/test11 allow the program arguments "--help"
and "--verbose". The argument "--verbose" produces verbose output essentially by
setting the error tolerance to zero. Verbose output can become quite large.

The test script ./test/test_optional.sh takes one parameter, and runs all
examples 00 to 16 in order, with the given parameter as a program argument.
Right now this is not very useful, because only ./test00 and ./test11 recognize
program arguments.

The test program ./gfft_test/gfft_test takes a parameter n, and transforms
larger and larger multivectors within the subalgebra defined by the frame of
the index set {-n, ..., -1, 1, ..., n}

The test program ./products/products takes a parameter n, and runs a timing
test which uses the products *, ^, % and & to multply larger and larger
multivectors within subalgebras defined by frames limited by the value of n.

The test program ./squaring/squaring takes a parameter n, and runs a timing
test which squares larger and larger multivectors within subalgebras defined
by frames limited by the value of n.

The test program ./transforms/transforms takes a parameter n, and transforms
larger and larger multivectors within the subalgebras defined by  frames
limited by the value of n.

The test script ./test/timing_tests.sh takes up to 4 numeric parameters.
The command "./test/timing_tests.sh $a $b $c $d" runs
 ./products/products $a
 ./squaring/squaring $b
 ./gfft_test/gfft_test $c
 ./transforms/transforms $d
The default is:
 ./products/products 8
 ./squaring/squaring 11
 ./gfft_test/gfft_test 11
 ./transforms/transforms 8

The sample timing test results in ./test_runtime are from programs
built and run using the configure command:
    ./configure --with-qd --with-eig=bindings  \
                --with-extra-includes=$PATHTO/numeric_bindings
on  Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU 870  @ 2.93GHz+ with
    Linux 3.19.0-26-generic #28-Ubuntu SMP x86_64
    gcc version 5.1.1 20150504 (Ubuntu 5.1.1-4ubuntu12)
    Boost 1.55.0
    Boost Numeric Bindings
    QD 2.3.13


Testing PyClical
----------------
Once you have built PyClical, run the doctests. In python or ipython, etc.:

 >>> import PyClical
 >>> PyClical._test()
 TestResults(failed=0, attempted=312)
 >>> quit()

Alternatively, in the directory pyclical, run the script test.py using:

ipython --classic --no-banner < test.py

and compare the output with test.out.

[ For ipython versions before 0.11 use: ipython -classic -nobanner < test.py ]

In the directory pyclical/demos, the Python script files pyclical_demo.py and
sqrt_log_demo.py have corresponding output files pyclical_demo.out and
sqrt_log_demo.out. Run these two Python script files and compare their output to
the contents of the two output files. See the README under "Using the PyClical
extension module with Python" for instructions on how to run these files.


To Install
==========

Once you are satisfied that GluCat works, you can run "make install".
This install the headers from ./glucat into the header installation directory,
$PREFIX/include, which defaults to /usr/local/include. If you have chosen to
build Pyclical, "make install" also installs the file PyClical.so into
a directory under $EPREFIX that is determined by the version of Python you are
running, for example /usr/local/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/.

You will need permission to update the installation directories, so you may need
to use sudo, login as root, or su to root before you run make install.


 List of Successful Builds
 =========================

 GluCat 0.7.5 with PyClical has so far been built and tested using:

 1) 4 core Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU 870  @ 2.93GHz with

    All eight configuration commands corresponding to each of the eight
    test.configure*.out files in ./test_runtime

 2) 2 core AMD E-350 Processor

    ./configure --with-qd --with-eig=bindings \
    --with-extra-libs=$HOME/usr/local/lib \
    --with-extra-includes=$PATHTO/numeric_bindings:$HOME/usr/local/include

    Linux 3.19.0-26-generic #28-Ubuntu SMP x86_64

Notes on software versions
--------------------------

    GluCat 0.7.5 has not been tested with gcc versions earlier than 4.9.2,
    Clang versions earlier than 3.4, Boost versions earlier than 1.55.0,
    QD versions earlier than 2.3.13, Python versions earlier than 2.7.9, or
    Cython versions earlier than 0.21.1.

    GluCat 0.7.5 has not been tested with Alglib or Boost Numeric Bindings V1.
    These libraries are deprecated and the configuration option to build with
    them has been removed.

    The following bugs and workarounds apply to earlier versions of GluCat,
    and may still be applicable to GluCat 0.7.5, but have not been checked
    for this version.

 1. GluCat needs an include library which either defines the macro isnan or
    defines std::isnan. The C++ standard library included with gcc 4.5.2 and
    above defines std::isnan.

 2. Cython versions earlier than 0.15 do not build PyClical correctly,
    because PyClical uses generators, which were only implemented with
    Cython 0.15.

 3. Cython versions to and including 0.16 do not build PyClical correctly
    for C++11. If you try to use g++ with -std=c++11 you will see
    an error message like:

 In function ‘void __Pyx_RaiseArgtupleInvalid(...)’:
 error: unable to find string literal operator ‘operator"" PY_FORMAT_SIZE_T’

    See https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/109

    The workaround is to edit PyClical.cpp and put a space before and after each
    occurrence of PY_FORMAT_SIZE_T. This was fixed some time after Cython 0.16.

 4. GluCat will not work with QD versions earlier than 2.3.10, because older
    versions of QD do not zero-initialize dd_real and qd_real as required by
    ublas::clear().

 5. With clang++ 3.2, building PyClical results in the warning

clang: warning: argument unused during compilation: '--param ssp-buffer-size=4'

    This is harmless, and was fixed after Clang version 3.2.
    See http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=15327

 6. With clang++ 3.4 and g++ 4.6 or earlier, if you use the configuration option
    --with-random=tr1 (the default), an error in a TR1 header file that is part
    of the C++ Standard Library for g++ will result in an error message like:

/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.6/../../../../include/c++/4.6/tr1/exp_integral.tcc:
      353:17: error: call to function
      '__expint_E1' that is neither visible in the template definition nor found
        by argument-dependent lookup
        return -__expint_E1(-__x);
                ^
    This bug is fixed in g++ 4.7.
    See http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29131

    To work around the problem, use a different option for --with-random, or
    try using g++ 4.7. Alternatively, you could try inserting the line

    template<typename _Tp> _Tp __expint_E1(const _Tp);

    at around line 59 of your copy of /usr/include/c++/4.6/tr1/exp_integral.tcc
