Before You Begin
================
 GluCat uses the C++ Standard Library and the Boost Library. Make sure
 you have these installed and working before attempting to use GluCat.
 Use the instructions at http://www.boost.org/more/download.html
 to obtain the Boost Library. GluCat has been tested with Boost 1.30.0.

 If you are using g++ 3.X.Y, make sure that you have installed Boost with the
same version of g++.

 The headers need a compiler which correctly handles template template classes.

 The code has so far been tested using:
 1) Red Hat Linux 8.0,       g++ 3.2,   Boost 1.30.2 on Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4.
 2) SuSE SEL 8,              g++ 3.2.2, Boost 1.30.2 on dual AMD Opteron(tm).
 3) SuSE Linux 9.0,          g++ 3.3.2, Boost 1.31.0 on AMD Athlon(tm) 64.
 4) SuSE Linux 9.0,          g++ 3.3.3, Boost 1.31.0 on AMD Athlon(tm) 64.
 5) Debian Linux (unstable), g++ 3.3.3, Boost 1.31.0 on Intel Itanium 2.

 Note: This version of GluCat does NOT compile under g++ 3.4. 
 
To Test
=======
 Once you have downloaded, unzipped and untarred the source code,
 you should have a directory, glucat-xxx, where xxx is the version number.
 Under glucat-xxx you should see a number of directories, including ./admin,
 ./glucat, ./glucat_gfft, ./glucat-api, ./squaring ./test and ./transforms
 The following instructions are meant to be used with glucat-xxx as the current
 directory.

The Test Programs
-----------------
 The test script ./test/test.sh takes any number (including zero) of numeric 
 parameters. Positive numbers in the range 1 to 16 correspond to coding examples
 ./test01/peg01.h to ./test16/peg16.h. These examples are run in numerical order.
 With zero parameters, all examples from 1 to 16 are run in order. Many of 
 the examples are run twice - once with framed_multi<Scalar_T> and once with 
 matrix_multi<Scalar_T>. 

 The test program ./gfft_test/gfft_test takes a parameter n, and transforms
 larger and larger multivectors within the subalgebra defined by the frame of
 the index set {-n, ..., -1, 1, ..., n}
 
 The test program ./squaring/squaring takes a parameter n, and runs a timing
 test which squares larger and larger multivectors within subalgebras defined
 by frames limited by the value of n.

 The test program ./transforms/transforms takes a parameter n, and transforms
 larger and larger multivectors within the subalgebras defined by  frames limited
 by the value of n.
 
To Make the Test Programs
-------------------------
 To create the GluCat test programs, set the environment variable CXX to 
 indicate your C++ compiler, eg. "g++" for GNU C++, "icc" for Intel C++, then
 run ./configure, then make.
 
 Make uses the headers in ./glucat and ./test and the source in ./test??,
 ./gfft_test, ./squaring and ./transforms to make the test programs
 ./test??/test??, ./gfft_test/gfft_test, ./squaring/squaring and
 ./transforms/transforms
 
 Once you have created the test programs, copy the runtime directory
 ./test_runtime to a convenient place. ./test_runtime contains the test input
 file eg8.txt. This file is needed by programming example 8 (reading multivectors
 from input).

 The sample test output files are eg3.res, test.out, gfft_test-10.out,
 squaring-6.out and transforms-6.out

 The main test script is ./test/test.sh. This runs tests ./test01/test01 to
 ./test16/test16, using relative pathnames, so it is best to leave test.sh
 where it is and invoke it using the full path name. This allows it to find
 test01 to test16.

 To create meaningful timing tests, run ./configure --enable-debug=no, then 
 make.  Setting --enable-debug=no will invoke the highest optimization level of 
 the relevant compiler. 
 
 To compile the tests using __gnu_cxx::hash_map for glucat::framed_multi<>, 
 run ./configure --with-hash-map, then make. This adds 
 -D_GLUCAT_USE_GNU_CXX_HASH_MAP to CXXFLAGS in the test Makefiles, depending 
 on whether you are using the g++ compiler. See "Usage" in README for details.
 
 If you are using Linux on Intel, you can also:
 o create a full debug version of the tests: 
   run ./configure --enable-debug=full, then make.
 o create a version for profiling:
   run ./configure --enable-profile, then make. 
   
 WARNINGS:
 1) The optimized compilation may take a long time to complete.
 See http://www.garloff.de/kurt/freesoft/gcc/

 2) With Red Hat g++ 2.96, do no try to set -finline-limit higher than
 900. Setting eg. -finline-limit=1000 resulted in a segmentation
 fault in uBLAS at runtime. This seems to be related to this bug:
 Bug 3777 Segmentation fault in simple program
 http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3777

 3) On Compaq Alpha, the -g flag for g++ 3.0.3 fails with "string too big".
 This problem seems similar to eg,
 http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/2000-06/msg00557.html
 http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/1998-04/msg00700.html
 Running ./configure --enable-debug=full will work, but will not use the -g 
 flag. 
 
 4) On Compaq Alpha, if the compilation does not use -mieee, Test 11 will fail,
 with a floating point exception.  GluCat is written for IEEE arithmetic
 and Compaq Alpha does not  use strict IEEE arithmetic unless you tell
 it to via -mieee. 
 ./configure automatically detects Compaq Alpha and uses the -mieee flag.
 
 5) Many Clifford algebra algorithms are exponential in both time and
 space complexity. In particular, programming example 7 (triality) may run
 very slowly.

 6) Detailed generic instructions for ./configure are given in "Basic
 Installation" below. See also ./configure --help

To Install
==========
 Once you are satisfied that GluCat works, you can run make install.
 What make install does is to install the headers from ./glucat into the
 installation directory, which defaults to /usr/local/include
 You will need permission to update this directory, so you may need to
 su to root before you run make install.

Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes a while.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
