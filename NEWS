GluCat is now compatible with gcc 3.2 and Intel C++ 7.0.
This should ensure that the code is closer to standard C++.
This version of GluCat was built using KDevelop 2.1.3 and Boost CVS (2002-12-28).
GluCat now uses Boost uBLAS rather than MTL, for a number of reasons:
1 MTL needed extensive patching to work with Intel C++.
2 MTL maintenance seems to have halted.
3 Joerg Walter contributed a uBLAS interface for GluCat.
4 uBLAS uses expression templates and uBLAS matrices have value semantics.
  This makes the relevant GluCat library code easier to read and understand.
5 GluCat with uBLAS compiles faster than with MTL.
6 uBLAS is also generally faster than MTL. This makes GluCat generally faster.
Other improvements to GluCat include better use of IEEE NaN.

GluCat has been finally updated to be compatible with gcc 3.1.1, autoconf 2.5.2 and automake 1.63.
This version of GluCat was built using KDevelop 2.1.2 and MTL 2.1.2-21.
Work continues to make GluCat and MTL compatible with Intel C++ 6.0.

A bug in elliptic() has been fixed. elliptic now returns a unit volume element I which
commutes with the whole relevant subalgebra

GluCat has now been tested with gcc 3.0.3 and should now be very compatible with standard C++.
2002-01-24: 0.0.4
GluCat now uses the real irreducible representation for matrix_multi<>, which should now run
acceptably quickly for Cl(p,0) and Cl(0,q).
2002-01-22: 0.0.3
A nasty bug in matrix_multi<>::operator==() is now fixed. cos(), sin() and
matrx_multi<>::norm() have been optimized.
2002-01-12: 0.0.2
GluCat now uses CVS.
