Purpose
-------
 GluCat is a library of template classes which models the universal Clifford
 algebras over the real field, with arbitrary dimension and arbitrary
 signature.  To do this, GluCat implements a model of each Clifford algebra
 corresponding to each non-degenerate quadratic form up to a maximum set by
 the user.

 GluCat classes are designed for use as numeric class template parameters with
 other template libraries, such as Blitz++, deal.II, Matrix Template Library 
 and POOMA. These template libraries expect a numeric class which implements
 "appropriate numeric semantics". To provide these semantics, the GluCat
 interface matches float or complex<> as much as possible. Yet the GluCat
 classes must be different from float or complex<>, because they model a
 different algebra.

Before you go any further
-------------------------
 Before you use this template library, become familiar with geometric and 
 Clifford algebras.

Usage
-----
 As of the current version there are no detailed usage instructions. What
 follows is a brief summary of usage. See also http://glucat.sourceforge.net

 To see brief descriptions of the classes, functions and operators which
 GluCat defines, see the Doxygen API documentation in ./glucat-api/html or
 ./glucat-api/refman.pdf.

 GluCat is a C++ template library, similar to the C++ Standard Library or the
 Boost uBLAS Library (uBLAS). It consists entirely of source code header
 files, plus a suite of test routines.

 To use GluCat:
 o Make sure that the installation directory is in your include path.
   The default installation directory is /usr/local/include
 o In your code, include individual files as <glucat/filename.h>
   You can also use the convenience headers <glucat/glucat.h> and
   <glucat/glucat_imp.h>
 o Use the test header files ./test/driver.h and ./transforms/transforms.h as
   guides. These contain lines which look something like:
 
#include "glucat/glucat.h"
typedef glucat::tuning<> Tune_P;
#include "glucat/glucat_imp.h"

 Tune_P is the tuning policy class. It may be included as a template parameter
 in future versions, but for now, you will need to define it as a typedef before
 including <glucat/glucat_imp.h>.
 The tuning<> template class is defined in glucat/global.h.
 Glucat defines and uses the glucat:: namespace. You can use names from this
 namespace by using the glucat:: prefix or by using the following declaration:

using namespace glucat;

 o GluCat uses preprocessor defines to control header files. In glucat/glucat.h:
 
 _GLUCAT_USE_TR1_UNORDERED_MAP controls the use of the header file
 <tr1/unordered_map>. 
 If _GLUCAT_USE_TR1_UNORDERED_MAP is defined, glucat/glucat.h includes this file, 
 which contains the declarations and definitions for std::tr1::unordered_map<>. 
 The main purpose of this definition is found in glucat/framed_multi.h.
 If _GLUCAT_USE_TR1_UNORDERED_MAP is defined, glucat/framed_multi.h defines 
 glucat::framed_multi<> using std::tr1::unordered_map<>, which is an unsorted map. 
 By default glucat/framed_multi.h defines glucat::framed_multi<> using std::map<>, 
 which is a sorted map.
 
 The configure script flag --with-unordered-map adds -D_GLUCAT_USE_TR1_UNORDERED_MAP
 to CXXFLAGS in the test Makefiles, depending on whether <tr1/unordered_map> can be
 found.  For your own compilation, check your compiler, and add 
 -D_GLUCAT_USE_TR1_UNORDERED_MAP to your own Makefile if you want to use
 std::tr1::unordered_map<>.

 _GLUCAT_USE_GNU_CXX_HASH_MAP controls the use of the header file <ext/hash_map>. 
 If _GLUCAT_USE_GNU_CXX_HASH_MAP is defined, glucat/glucat.h includes this file, 
 which contains the GNU declarations and definitions for __gnu_cxx::hash_map<>. 
 If _GLUCAT_USE_GNU_CXX_HASH_MAP is defined, glucat/framed_multi.h defines 
 glucat::framed_multi<> using __gnu_cxx::hash_map<>, which is an unsorted map. 
 
 The configure script flag --with-hash-map adds -D_GLUCAT_USE_GNU_CXX_HASH_MAP
 to CXXFLAGS in the test Makefiles, depending on whether you are using the g++
 compiler.  For your own compilation, check your compiler, and add 
 -D_GLUCAT_USE_GNU_CXX_HASH_MAP to your own Makefile if you want to use
 __gnu_cxx::hash_map<>.

 _GLUCAT_USE_DENSE_MATRICES controls the use of dense matrices.
 The main purpose of this definition is found in glucat/matrix_multi.h.
 If _GLUCAT_USE_DENSE_MATRICES is defined, glucat/matrix_multi.h defines 
 glucat::matrix_multi<> using ublas::matrix<>, which is a dense matrix.
 Otherwise matrix_multi.h defines glucat::matrix_multi<> using 
 ublas::compressed_matrix<>, which a compressed matrix type. In either case,
 basis matrices always use ublas::compressed_matrix<>.
 
 The configure script flag --with-dense-mat adds -D_GLUCAT_USE_DENSE_MATRICES
 to CXXFLAGS in the test Makefiles. For your own compilation you will need to add
 -D_GLUCAT_USE_DENSE_MATRICES to your own Makefile.

 _GLUCAT_USE_QD controls the use of the QD high precision floating point library.
 If _GLUCAT_USE_QD is defined, glucat/glucat.h includes qd/qd_config.h and glucat/qd.h.
 The file glucat/qd.h supports the use of QD in GluCat by defining specializations for
 numeric_traits<dd_real> and numeric_traits<qd_real>.

 The configure script flag --with-qd adds -D_GLUCAT_USE_QD to CXXFLAGS and adds
 the flag -lqd to the list of libraries all_libraries in the test Makefiles.
 For your own compilation you will need to add -D_GLUCAT_USE_QD and -lqd to
 your own Makefile. You will also need to ensure that the include path used by
 the compiler sees qd/qd_config.h and the library path sees libqd.a.

Coding standards
----------------
 
 The headers are split into declarations and definitions. The software was
 developed using the g++ compiler, which does not implement the "export" keyword.
 Separate compilation is possible, if you include both the declarations and
 definitions in each compilation unit, but compilation is slow and the resulting
 binary is large.
 
 The code follows many, but not all of the guidelines in the
 GNU C++ Standard Library Style Guidelines at
 http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/17_intro/C++STYLE
 The code also follows much of Scott Meyers' advice from "Effective C++",
 Second Edition.

 Some code conventions are:
 name_t: The name of a type, either global or local to a class.
 Sentence_Case_T: The name of a type used as a template parameter.
 Other_Sentence_Case: Other template parameters, including template template
 parameters.
 ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES: A global constant defined in <glucat/global.h>
